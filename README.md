# webviz_natcap

Prototype of webapp to visualize ecosystem services model outputs.

Example case : Combining multiple ES objectives in the Tana watershed

Specific goals: the visualization should allow to 
* Compare many portfolios [both “pairwise” selecting pairs to look at, and also summarizing multiple]
* Location of synergies of intervention/scenario on multiple ES metrics 
* Location of tradeoffs of intervention/scenario on multiple ES metrics
* Understand trade-offs and synergies between  > 3 objectives under small number of scenarios
* Characterize uncertainty in spatial model output - derived from multiple runs
