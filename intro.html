	<h1> The Upper Tana Nairobi Waterfund </h1>

			<!--<b>60%</b> of Nairobi’s residents do not have access to a reliable water supply. To solve this issue, the Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund undertakes upstream water and soil conservation measures, resulting in improved water quality and supply.-->
			The Upper Tana-Nairobi Water Fund is an initiative bringing together [X, Y, Z] to promote [clean and reliable water supplies for downstream stakeholders, while simultaneously fostering sustainable livelihoods for upstream farmers and others.] The main “on-the-ground” action the fund can take is the identification and prioritization of extension activities, whereby actors on the landscape (mainly farmers) are visited by local NGO’s to diagnose and offer incentives for ways to improve their yields and improve water-related outcomes. Ideally, achieving all these good outcomes simultaneously, though in some places there might be trade-offs, which the Fund is interested in minimizing. The priority watersheds under consideration are [the three, link to map below].

			<h5>Ecosystem services (ES)</h5>
			<p>Ecosystem services are the benefits natural capital assets provide to humanity</p>
			<p>Three related <b> ecosystem services (ES) objectives </b>are being acted upon:
			<ul> <li class='browser_default'> * <em> Annual water yield </em> (AWY) to be maximized, as it serves water supply and hydropower needs </li>
				<li> * <em> Sediment export to streams </em> (SDE) to be minimized, as it harms reservoir and water treatment operations, among others</li>
				<li> * <em> Soil erosion </em>  (SDL) to be minimzed, as it reduces agricultural productivity</li> </ul></p>

			<h5>Interventions</h5>
			<p>Objective: Spatially targeting interventions to enhance ecosystem services.</p>
			<p>The goal of the Waterfund is to optimize <b><i>which interventions to undertake in the Upper Tana basin</i></b>, in order to improve water quality and quantity supplying Nairobi.</p>
			<p>Possible interventions are Road mitigation, Agroforestry, Riparian management, Terracing, Reforestation, Grass strips</p>
			<p>The ability to achieve multiple objectives simultaneously while minimizing negative impacts is a function of <b><i>what</i></b> is recommended, but also <b><i>where</i></b> it is recommended. </p>

			<h5>Portfolios</h5>
			<p>scenarios: different runs of the model with varying objective weights and input parameters’ values led to generation of different intervention scenarios… (define scenario well!)</p>
			<p>About 800 <b>portfolios</b> were generated, arising from parametric uncertainty (4 parameters with 2 to 4 possible values each) and 15 combinations of objectives weights.</p>

			<ul> <h5> Visualization of optimization results for each watershed </h5>
				<p>Understanding the optimizer results, comparing portfolios, assessing trade-offs and uncertainty is complex due the multiplicity of metrics, objectives, scenarios and the nature of the data (often spatial). In between communication and exploratory purposes, these interactive dashboards allow to explore the large and interconnected dataset, allowing to visualize tradeoffs between objectives, compare scenarios and assess uncertainty.</p>

		<p>Draft in construction :
			The ability to achieve multiple objectives simultaneously while minimizing negative impacts is a function of what is recommended, but also where it is recommended. For example, if one only cares about avoiding sediment in streams, then buffers where agricultural land meets streams may be most effective -- but upland soils could still lose productivity. In this case an intervention that prevents on-field erosion likely will have dual benefits. Yet, at the same time, the increase in yields may reduce water reaching streams as plants utilize additional water.

			This general problem is one that can be formalized as a “multi-objective optimization” -- ecosystem services models that represent changing management of the landscape can be run in combination with solvers to identify landscape configurations that can approximate the best combination of a given combination of objectives, and also to understand how the recommended configuration changes. Because different actors may have different priorities, and because modeled outcomes can only be modeled imprecisely, it is illuminating to consider how portfolios and their performance change in response to these alternative values and scenarios. By doing so, one can gain insight into relationships and identify recommendations that meet multiple priorities in a variety of possible [future] worlds.

		<h4>The general priorities:</h4>

		To begin, we model three related goals, detailed higher in section (ES)

		For the time being these are represented in biophysical service terms. Other biophysical objectives we are interested in including are dry season baseflow, and translating soil loss into implications for agricultural productivity or yield. Longer term we may also add valuation associated with different biophysical outputs, or transformation of biophysical outputs to other benefit relevant metrics. The focus of this document is to provide an orientation to the general approach of multi-objective optimization under uncertainty, and the added benefits of the included visualization tool. [ALSO, EQUITY IN SPACE AND POPULATION, SUB-OBJECTIVES ETC]

		<h5> Question A</h5>
		<p>Why it's an interesting q?</p>
		<p> Viz solution</p>

		<h5> How do the portfolios expand with budget ?</h5>

		<p>Why it's an interesting q?</p>
		<p> Viz solution (sliders)</p>


		One run of a spatial optimizer answers the question:

		Given a known weighting on changing objectives (ie, how much increase in sediment export I’m willing to give up for a change in water yield), where are on the landscape are likely to be best places to promote specific activities, and what changes in each objective can I expect to see?

		This results in two main outputs: One is a “portfolio” that is a set of pixels on the landscape, indicating where to do what activity (given a budget constraint). The second is a score for each objective, that can be visualized on a number of 2-d plots, or a parallel coordinate plot [see X].

		When we generate multiple portfolios under different priorities (eg, how much concern is given to sediment, versus water yield), we can trace-out a trade-off curve, under one [scenario/set of assumptions.]


		We can then use various maps and other statistics to answer questions like:


		<h5>How does the portfolio composition change as priorities are changed? </h5>
		<p>In terms of what activities are recommended [answered by pie chart]
		In terms of where activities are recommended [answered by comparing maps]

		Dynamic features : The above could be answered by making plots too, but much easier to see the general response and go back and forth between associated maps.] </p>
			
		<h5>What parts of the landscape have high agreement for activities to be chosen, regardless of priorities?  
		[% agreement map]</h5>


		<p>WHAT DYNAMIC VIZ ADDS: In many cases, users may not know ahead of time exactly what regions of the trade-off curve are acceptable or not, but stakeholder discussion can narrow down to parts of the curve -- not focusing on one single exact weighting combination, but also not considering the entire frontier. Brushing helps [YADA YADA].  </p>


		<h5>What parts of the landscape should I focus/NOT focus on:</h5>
		<p>Footprint</p>


		What common properties of solutions that do well on one or more objectives?

		How robust is characterization of tradeoffs?
